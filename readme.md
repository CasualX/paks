The PAKS file is a lightweight encrypted archive inspired by the Quake PAK format.

üîí Security
-----------

This library implements a _"Bring Your Own Authenticated Encryption"_ scheme using [Speck128/128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speck_\(cipher\))
in [CTR mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_\(CTR\)) with a [CBC-MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC-MAC).

**Disclaimer**: This is **not** a production-grade cryptosystem. It's designed for obfuscation and integrity checking of game assets in hobby projects. Think of it as experimental and fun, use at your own risk.

üõ†Ô∏è Command-line
---------------

This project ships with `PAKStool`, a command-line utility for creating and editing PAKS files.

```
cargo install paks
```

This installs `PAKStool` for manipulating archives:

USAGE
    PAKStool help <COMMAND>
    PAKStool <PAKFILE> <KEY> <COMMAND> [..]

ARGUMENTS
    PAKFILE  Path to a PAKS archive to create or edit.
    KEY      The 128-bit encryption key encoded in hex.
    COMMAND  The subcommand to invoke.

Commands are:
    new      Creates a new empty PAKS archive.
    tree     Displays the directory of the PAKS archive.
    add      Adds a file to the PAKS archive.
    copy     Copies files to the PAKS archive.
    link     Links the file from alternative paths.
    cat      Reads files from the PAKS archive and writes to stdout.
    rm       Removes paths from the PAKS archive.
    mv       Moves files in the PAKS archive.
    gc       Collects garbage left behind by removed files.

    See `PAKStool help <COMMAND>` for more information on a specific command.

EXAMPLES
    PAKStool example.paks 0 new
    PAKStool example.paks 0 add a/b/example < tests/data/example.txt
    PAKStool example.paks 0 link a/b/example aa/bb/example
    PAKStool example.paks 0 tree -u
    PAKStool example.paks 0 rm a/b/example
    PAKStool example.paks 0 cat aa/bb/example
```

üìñ Examples
-----------

Here's how to create a new PAKS file and add some content:

Try it locally with: `cargo run --example readme1`.

```rust
// This file contains 65 bytes filled with `0xCF`.
const DATA: &[u8] = &[0xCF; 65];

fn main() {
	let ref key = [13, 42];

	// Create the editor object to create PAKS files in memory.
	let mut edit = paks::MemoryEditor::new();

	// Let's create a file `foo` under a directory `sub`.
	// If a file already exists by this name it will be overwritten.
	edit.create_file(b"sub/foo", DATA, key);

	// When done the editor object can be finalized and returns the encrypted PAKS file as a `Vec<Block>`.
	// It also returns the unencrypted directory for final inspection if desired.
	let (paks, dir) = edit.finish(key);

	// Print the directory.
	print!("The directory:\n\n```\n{}```\n\n", dir.display());

	// Print the PAKS file itself.
	print!("The RAW data:\n\n```\n{:x?}\n```\n", paks);

	// Create the reader object to inspect PAKS files in memory.
	let read = paks::MemoryReader::from_blocks(paks, key).unwrap();

	// Find the file created earlier and read its data into a `Vec<u8>`.
	let data = read.read(b"sub/foo", key).unwrap();

	// Check that it still matches the expected data.
	assert_eq!(DATA, &data[..]);
}
```

üìÇ File layout
--------------

The structure of a PAKS archive is straightforward:

* _Header_ ‚Äî contains the version number and directory location.

  - Everything is encrypted, so without the correct key you can't tell if a blob is a valid PAKS file.

* _Data_ ‚Äî opaque blocks of file contents, decryptable only using directory information.

* _Directory_ ‚Äî a sequence of descriptors in a lightweight [TLV format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value).

  - File descriptors: store file location + cryptographic nonce for decryption.
  - Directory descriptors: store how many child descriptors follow.

+-------------------+
|      Header       |  --> Contains version + pointer to Directory
+-------------------+
|                   |
|      File A       |
|                   |  --> Data: Encrypted sections (opaque blocks)
|      File B       |
|                   |
+-------------------+
|     Directory     |  --> List of descriptors:
|   +-----------+   |
|   | File A    | --+----> File descriptors: Metadata + pointer to Data
|   +-----------+   |
|   | File B    | --+----> File descriptors: Includes nonce + MAC for integrity
|   +-----------+   |
|   | Dir/..    | --+----> Directory descriptors: Define hierarchy
|   +-----------+   |
